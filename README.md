# This repository fit the refractive index of substrate, thickness and refractive index of a single layer coating based on the Particle swarm optimization(PSO).  
The Cauchy formula is used in the refractive index model.  

### [single_layer_fitting.py] is the main function；[1] 
### [psomain.py]  is the main function of PSO；  
### [meritFunc.py] calculates the merit function of PSO;  
### [main.py] calculates the transmittance of substrates or single layer coatings.
