## This repository fit the refractive index of substrate and thickness and refractive index of a single layer coating 
### Method based on the Particle swarm optimization(PSO) through the reference of transmittance of substrates and single layer coatings.  
### The Cauchy formula is used in the refractive index model.  

### [single_layer_fitting.py][1] is the main function 
### [psomain.py][2]  is the main function of PSO 
### [meritFunc.py][3] calculates the merit function of PSO 
### [main.py][4] calculates the transmittance of substrates and single layer coatings 
### substrate.cs vand singleLayer.csv are the transmission spectrums data of substrate and single layer coating
