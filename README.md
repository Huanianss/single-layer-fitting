# This repository fit the refractive index of substrate or thickness and refractive index of a single layer coating based on the Particle swarm optimization(PSO) through the the transmittance of substrates or single layer coatings.  
The Cauchy formula is used in the refractive index model.  

### [single_layer_fitting.py] is the main function[1]
### [psomain.py]  is the main function of PSO[2]
### [meritFunc.py] calculates the merit function of PSO[3]
### [main.py] calculates the transmittance of substrates or single layer coatings[4]
