## This repository fit the refractive index of substrate or thickness and refractive index of a single layer coating based on the Particle swarm optimization(PSO) through the the transmittance of substrates or single layer coatings.  
The Cauchy formula is used in the refractive index model.  

### [single_layer_fitting.py][1] is the main function 
### [psomain.py][2]  is the main function of PSO 
### [meritFunc.py][3] calculates the merit function of PSO 
### [main.py][4] calculates the transmittance of substrates or single layer coatings
