This repository fit the refractive index of substrate, thickness and refractive index of a single layer coating based on the Particle swarm optimization(PSo).
The Cauchy formula is used in the refractive index model.

single layer fitting.py is the main function；
psomain.py  is the main function of PSO；
meritFunc.py calculates the merit function of PSO;
main.py calculates the transmittance of substrates or single layer coatings;
